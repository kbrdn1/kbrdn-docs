Added by [#73](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/73) / [#74](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/pull/74); split into a PTY overlay (`o`) and a fullscreen variant (`O`) in [#35](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/35) / [#290](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/290).

Two bindings open something at the selected worktree:

| Key | Action slug           | What it does                                                                      |
| :-- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `o` | `terminal_pty`        | a native `$SHELL` session in an **embedded PTY overlay** (~90 % of the screen)    |
| `O` | `terminal_fullscreen` | the **fullscreen** open dispatch driven by `[tui.open]` (shell / editor / finder) |

Both slugs are rebindable under [`[tui.keys]`](/configuration/gwm-toml#tuikeys).

## `o` - terminal in an embedded PTY overlay

`o` drops a native `$SHELL` session into a [`portable-pty`](https://docs.rs/portable-pty) + [`tui-term`](https://docs.rs/tui-term) overlay sized to roughly 90 % × 90 % of the terminal, with `cwd` set to the worktree - the same overlay machinery as the `l` git-TUI overlay. The TUI never leaves the alt-screen; the worktree list stays visible behind the modal. Keystrokes are forwarded to the shell; `Esc` closes the overlay (or `exit` the shell - the overlay auto-closes when the child exits).

## `O` - fullscreen open dispatch

`O` dispatches on the `[tui.open]` section in `.gwm.toml`. Three modes are supported.

## Configuration

```toml
[tui.open]
mode = "shell"          # "shell" (default) | "editor" | "finder"
shell_cmd = ""           # override $SHELL; empty = use $SHELL
editor_cmd = "hx"        # override $EDITOR; empty = use $EDITOR
```

Unknown `mode` values are a **hard config error at load time**, surfaced before the TUI opens - no silent fallback. The error names the file, the line, and the supported values, so the fix is one keystroke.

## Modes

### `shell` (default - changed in v0.6)

Suspend the TUI and spawn `$SHELL` (or `shell_cmd` if set) with `cwd` set to the worktree - same lifecycle as the `L` fullscreen git-TUI launcher. When you exit the shell, the gwm TUI restores exactly where you left it.

```
O   →   $SHELL    inside /Users/you/cc-worktree/myrepo/feat-42-user-auth
exit→   gwm TUI restored
```

> For an embedded shell that keeps the worktree list visible, press `o` (the PTY overlay) instead - it never suspends the TUI.

This is the lazygit-style flow - drop into a shell, run whatever, come back to the TUI without losing selection or filter state.

### `editor`

Suspend the TUI and run `$EDITOR <worktree-path>` (or `editor_cmd <worktree-path>` if set). Useful for terminal editors that own the alt-screen (helix, nvim, micro):

```toml
[tui.open]
mode = "editor"
editor_cmd = "hx"        # override $EDITOR for this repo
```

For GUI editors that fork off the terminal, prefer `mode = "shell"` with a custom `shell_cmd` that launches the editor - that way the TUI doesn't suspend uselessly while the GUI runs.

### `finder` - pre-v0.6 behaviour

Hand off to the OS file manager **without** suspending the TUI:

- macOS: `open <path>`
- Linux: `xdg-open <path>`
- Windows: `explorer <path>`

This is the pre-v0.6 default; opt back in with `mode = "finder"`. Useful when the worktree carries binary assets you actually want to inspect in the OS file picker.

## Why the default changed

The pre-v0.6 open key opened the OS file manager unconditionally, but the most common follow-up was "now I want a shell here" - so most users ended up either ignoring it entirely or wiring it through a `yank-path-and-cd` workaround. v0.6 made `shell` the default `[tui.open]` mode.

Opt back into the old finder flow with two lines in `.gwm.toml`:

```toml
[tui.open]
mode = "finder"
```
