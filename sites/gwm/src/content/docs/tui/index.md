![gwm TUI: worktree table and details sidebar](../../../assets/captures/hero.png)

Bare `gwm` (no arguments) opens the ratatui interface on the current repo. From there you can create, delete, bootstrap, and jump between worktrees without leaving the terminal.

- **[Keybindings](/tui/keybindings)**: the full key map, including the [v0.10 keymap redesign (#290)](/tui/keybindings#v010-rebind-summary) that reshuffled the defaults (e.g. `O` is now the fullscreen terminal, not open-menu; `y` now yanks the branch name, not the path). The keymap is fully configurable via `[tui.keys]`.
- **[Details sidebar](/tui/sidebar)**: the four-bordered subsections on the right pane, the responsive orientation, the lazygit-style commit graph, the live Issue / PR block (with the CI status indicator), the `git status` file-explorer tree, and the `S` stashes mode.
- **[Fuzzy filter](/tui/filter)**: `/` opens the inline filter bar; nucleo-matcher under the hood.
- **[Confirm-overlay countdown](/tui/confirm-countdown)**: the safety countdown that prevents accidental branch deletions when `D` is armed.
- **[Configurable launchers](/tui/launchers)**: `[git_tui]` (`l` overlay / `L` fullscreen) and `[review]` (`r` overlay / `R` fullscreen), with `{base} {head} {path} {diff}` placeholders and the embedded PTY overlay.
- **[Open dispatch](/tui/open-dispatch)**: `o` opens a terminal in an embedded PTY overlay; `O` runs the `[tui.open]` dispatch (`shell` / `editor` / `finder`).
- **[Exec / clean overlays](/tui/keybindings#exec-picker-overlay-x)**: `x` picks an `[exec.profiles]` profile and runs it in a PTY overlay; `X` previews and reclaims build artifacts (same git-ignored safety gate as `gwm clean --yes`, behind a confirm countdown).
- **[Themes](/tui/themes)**: role-based `[theme]` colours and the built-in presets (`catppuccin`, `gruvbox`, `tokyo-night`, `claude-dark`).
- **[Keymap & command palette](/tui/keymap-and-palette)**: remap any binding via `[tui.keys]` (with chord support), or fire an action by name from the `:` palette.

`n` (new worktree) and `b` (re-bootstrap) are gated by the [TOFU trust ledger](/configuration/trust-ledger): an untrusted `.gwm.toml` lands a refuse message in the status bar rather than running bootstrap. The picker variant (`gwm switch`, alias `gwm s`) reuses the same TUI but disables create / delete / bootstrap, then prints the chosen worktree's path on stdout, meant to be `eval`d by the `gcd` shell wrapper.

## Chrome

The v0.8.0 polish pass tightened the TUI's frame. All colours follow the resolved [`[theme]`](/tui/themes):

- **Statusline**: a single line. Key hints render as reverse-video badge chips (the key painted with the theme accent, then a short label); the status message (action log) is pinned flush-right with absolute priority. Under width pressure the hint list truncates with an `…` marker while the log stays visible.
- **Header**, a single borderless row: the version is a reverse-video chip, the repo name is bold, and the working directory is dimmed and tilde-compressed. The `picker` flag is its own reverse-video chip. Drop order under width pressure is path → repo name → version chip (the version survives last).
- **Modals** all share one frame: a rounded border with a bold themed title, theme colours, and a box sized to its content rather than a fixed percentage of the screen.
