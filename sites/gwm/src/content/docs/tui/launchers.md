Added by [#75](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/75) / [#76](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/pull/76); the embedded PTY overlay landed in [#35](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/35).

Two configurable launchers, the **git TUI** (lazygit by default) and the **review** tool, are driven by user-configurable `.gwm.toml` sections sharing the same mini-API. Both take a `command` template string, substitute placeholders, split with [`shell-words`](https://docs.rs/shell-words), and exec the result with `cwd = worktree.path`.

Each launcher has **two bindings** (issue [#35](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/35) / [#290](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/290)) that share the same resolved command but differ in how the child is hosted:

| Key | Action slug          | How it runs                                                      |
| :-- | :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `l` | `lazygit_pty`        | git TUI in an **embedded PTY overlay** (~90 % of the screen)     |
| `L` | `lazygit_fullscreen` | git TUI **fullscreen**, honours `[git_tui] fullscreen`           |
| `r` | `review_pty`         | review tool in an **embedded PTY overlay** (~90 % of the screen) |
| `R` | `review_fullscreen`  | review tool **fullscreen**, honours `[review] fullscreen`        |

All four slugs are rebindable under [`[tui.keys]`](/configuration/gwm-toml#tuikeys).

## The embedded PTY overlay (`l` / `r`)

The PTY variants run the launcher **inside the TUI**: no alt-screen swap, no suspend. The child program is driven by a real pseudo-terminal ([`portable-pty`](https://docs.rs/portable-pty)) and rendered as a [`tui-term`](https://docs.rs/tui-term) widget in a modal sized to roughly 90 % × 90 % of the terminal. The worktree list stays visible behind the overlay border.

- Keystrokes are forwarded straight to the child, so lazygit / your review tool behave exactly as they do in a normal terminal.
- `Esc` closes the overlay and returns to the list. Inside lazygit, its own `q` quits lazygit, and the overlay auto-closes when the child exits.
- The PTY variants **ignore** the section's `fullscreen` field. That field only governs the fullscreen bindings below. The PTY overlay is always embedded.

## The fullscreen variants (`L` / `R`)

The `L` / `R` bindings keep the original launch model. They read the same resolved command but host the child outside the overlay:

| Step | What happens                                                                                                                                                |
| :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Read the `[git_tui]` or `[review]` section from `.gwm.toml` (defaults below).                                                                               |
| 2    | Resolve placeholders: `{path}`, `{base}`, `{head}`, `{diff}`.                                                                                               |
| 3    | Split the result into `argv` with `shell-words` (handles quoting like a POSIX shell).                                                                       |
| 4    | Probe `argv[0]` against `$PATH`. Missing binary → status-bar error, no spawn, no flicker.                                                                   |
| 5    | If `fullscreen = true` → suspend the TUI (raw mode off, alt-screen left), spawn `Command::status()`, restore on exit.                                       |
| 6    | If `fullscreen = false` → keep the TUI in the alt-screen, spawn `Command::output()`, **block** until exit, drop the first line of stderr on the status bar. |

The `{diff}` placeholder is **lazy**: gwm only materialises a tempfile holding `git diff {base}..{head}` when the template references `{diff}`. The tempfile's lifetime is bound to the spawned process (its `Drop` impl unlinks on completion), so the reviewer always sees a consistent snapshot.

> **`fullscreen = false` is synchronous.** The TUI is **unresponsive** until the child process exits: `Command::output()` waits for it. Fine for quick print-only tools (`claude --print`, `gh pr view --web`); pick `fullscreen = true` for anything long-running so the TUI is properly suspended and your terminal stays usable.

## `[git_tui]`: the git TUI (`l` / `L`)

Default: `lazygit -p {path}`, fullscreen.

```toml
[git_tui]
# command template (single placeholder: {path}). Pre-v0.6 behaviour
# is the default — your existing configs see zero change.
command = "lazygit -p {path}"

# suspend the TUI for the call (recommended for TUIs that own the alt-screen)
fullscreen = true
```

Any tool that takes a worktree path works:

```toml
[git_tui]
command = "gitui -d {path}"        # gitui

[git_tui]
command = "tig --all"              # tig (run inside the worktree)
fullscreen = true

[git_tui]
command = "code -n {path}"         # VS Code in a new window
fullscreen = false                  # IDE forks, don't suspend
```

## `[review]`: the review tool (`r` / `R`)

No default: both `r` and `R` are inert until configured.

Two equivalent ways to configure it:

### A) free-form `command` (full control)

```toml
[review]
command = "claude --print 'review the diff {base}..{head}'"
fullscreen = false
default_base = "main"               # optional, see "base resolution chain" below
```

### B) `tool = "<preset>"` (sugar)

```toml
[review]
tool = "lumen"                      # shorthand for the table below
```

| Preset   | Expanded `command`                                | `fullscreen` |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------- |
| `lumen`  | `lumen diff {base}..{head}`                       | `true`       |
| `claude` | `claude --print 'review the diff {base}..{head}'` | `false`      |
| `codex`  | `codex review {base}..{head}`                     | `false`      |
| `aider`  | `aider --message 'review {base}..{head}'`         | `true`       |
| `gh`     | `gh pr view --web`                                | `false`      |

If both `command` and `tool` are set in the same block, `command` wins and the TUI shows a one-shot warning at startup ("your `tool = X` is shadowed by `command`") so you notice the dead config.

## Placeholders

| Placeholder | Available in    | Expanded to                                                                     |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{path}`    | both            | absolute path of the selected worktree                                          |
| `{base}`    | `[review]` only | result of the [base resolution chain](#base-resolution)                         |
| `{head}`    | `[review]` only | the current branch name (`branch.<name>` in git config)                         |
| `{diff}`    | `[review]` only | absolute path of a tempfile holding `git diff {base}..{head}` (lazy, see above) |

Referencing `{diff}` in a `[git_tui]` template is a config error caught at load time (the git TUI launcher doesn't carry the repo handle needed to materialise the diff).

## Base resolution

The `{base}` placeholder follows this chain, and the first non-empty hit wins:

1. **`branch.<name>.merge`**: the branch's upstream tracking ref, if any.
2. **`branch.<name>.gwm-base`**: set automatically by `gwm create` so the original parent stays recoverable even when the upstream is dropped.
3. **`[review].default_base`**: the user-configured fallback in `.gwm.toml`.
4. **`dev`**: gwm's project convention (only if `dev` exists locally).
5. **`main`**: universal git default (final sentinel, guaranteed non-empty).

The chain is implemented in [`src/launcher.rs::resolve_review_base`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/src/launcher.rs#L167-L187). The fallback prefers `dev` only when it exists locally: returning `dev` blindly when the repo only has `main` would make the launcher's subsequent `git rev-list` / `git diff` calls fail loudly (caught by Copilot's review on PR #76).

## Interaction with `gwm doctor`

`gwm doctor` (post-v0.6) probes the resolved `[git_tui]` binary (plus the `[review]` binary when a review launcher is configured) against `$PATH` as part of its `external binaries on PATH` check:

- Any launcher binary missing → **Warning** (exit code `1`), naming the binaries that aren't on `$PATH`. The review launcher is only probed when you've actually configured one (`command` or `tool`), so an unconfigured `[review]` is never flagged.

See [Integrations → `gwm doctor`](/integrations/doctor) for the full check breakdown.
