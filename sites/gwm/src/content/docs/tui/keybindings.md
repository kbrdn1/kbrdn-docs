The full key map for `gwm`'s ratatui interface. Press `?` at any time for the same table as an in-app overlay.

![The `?` in-app Keybindings overlay](../../../assets/captures/keybindings.png)

> **The keymap is fully configurable.** Every binding below is a
> **default**: the `[tui.keys]` block in `.gwm.toml` rebinds any
> list-view action, including multi-key chords like `g g`. The `?`
> help overlay is keymap-driven, so it always renders the bindings you
> actually resolved, not these defaults. See [Keymap & command
> palette](/tui/keymap-and-palette) and
> [Configuration → `[tui.keys]`](/configuration/gwm-toml#tuikeys).
>
> **Modal keys are rebindable too.** The keys inside each overlay below are
> defaults of typed verbs under `[tui.keys.modal.<context>]`
> ([#219](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/219)). The same physical key
> can mean different things per modal (`Enter` is `submit` in the create form
> but `activate` in the delete-confirm modal). `Ctrl+C`, the list view's
> contextual `Esc` / `Enter`, and the PTY overlay's emergency `Esc` stay
> hard-coded by design. See [Keymap & command
> palette](/tui/keymap-and-palette#rebindable-modal-keys).

> **Keymap redesign (v0.10)**: [#290](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/290)
> reshuffled the list-view bindings into logical chords and added several
> verbs (pull / push, rename, exit-to-worktree, branch / worktree-name yanks,
> mux pane, user macros). The table below is the resolved default set printed by
> `gwm tui keys`. Pre-#290 `[tui.keys]` slugs (`git_tui`, `review`, `yank`,
> `open`, `open_menu`, …) still load through backward-compat aliases, so an
> existing override keeps working.

## Bulk delete (`Space` + `d`)

`Space` marks the highlighted worktree, `d` then deletes **every marked row** in
one batch. With nothing marked, `d` is the single-row delete it has always been.
A `✓` column appears while the set is non-empty, and the pane footer carries the
count (`3 of 12 · 2 marked`).

Only `d` reads the mark set. `b` / `s` / `p` and every other verb keep acting on
the highlighted row, which is exactly why the footer shows the count.

- **Lifetime**: opening the filter (`/`) and the manual refresh (`f`) clear the
  marks. The background auto-refresh does not, it only drops rows that no longer
  exist, so a 60s timer cannot eat a selection you are still building. Marking
  inside a filtered view works, and marks are keyed by path so they survive the
  fuzzy reranking.
- **The main worktree** cannot be marked, same reason `d` refuses it.
- **Confirm**: for a batch the overlay reports `N selected` and how many targets
  carry a branch instead of listing rows, and `D` arms the branch deletion for
  the whole batch, not per row.
- **Failures** do not stop the batch: every target is attempted, the list
  reloads, the status line reads `removed 2 of 3 worktrees; failed: …`, and the
  confirm stays open narrowed to what failed. A row that is still listed keeps
  its mark, so a retry is one keystroke; one that git already dropped from its
  list (a removal that pruned the admin entry and then failed on the
  filesystem) leaves the directory behind for `gwm prune` and a manual delete.

- **Hooks and undo**: a delete here runs the same sequence `gwm remove` does,
  so `[hooks.pre_remove]` / `[hooks.post_remove]` fire and every removed
  worktree is recorded for [`gwm undo`](/cli/reference#gwm-undo---bootstrap),
  one entry per worktree. A `pre_remove` that refuses refuses that target and
  the batch carries on. There is no `--skip-hooks` here; to delete past a
  hook, use the CLI with `--force`. Because a hook is code out of `.gwm.toml`,
  a repo whose config defines remove hooks is checked against the
  [trust ledger](/configuration/trust-ledger) first, and an unapproved one
  refuses the delete instead of skipping the hook.

The non-interactive counterpart is [`gwm remove a b c`](/cli/reference#gwm-remove-pattern---delete-branch---dry-run).

`Space` was the sidebar layout cycle before [#484](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/484); that verb now lives on `z`. Both defaults are one `[tui.keys]` line away (`cycle_sidebar_layout = ["Space"]`, `toggle_select = ["z"]`). If your `.gwm.toml` binds a chord _starting_ with `z` (say `top = ["z z"]`), that is now a prefix conflict against a shipped default and is refused at load time: rebind it, or move `cycle_sidebar_layout` somewhere else.

## Notes (`N`)

`N` opens the selected worktree's note in a modal you type straight into. A note is usually three lines written in the ten seconds between two thoughts, and suspending the whole TUI to spawn an editor is a heavier gesture than that. `Ctrl+e` inside the modal hands the same file to `$EDITOR` when the note needs more, through the handoff `o` uses in [`mode = "editor"`](/tui/open-dispatch): `editor_cmd` in `.gwm.toml`, then `$EDITOR`, then `vi`. What that editor writes is reloaded into the modal when it exits.

**`Esc` writes and closes.** There is no "quit without saving" - the reflex on leaving a note is to keep it, and the alternative makes `Esc` destroy prose nothing can regenerate. To delete a note, empty it: a blank buffer removes the file rather than leaving one that reads as absent everywhere. A buffer nothing touched is not written at all, so opening a note to read it does not move its mtime.

The editor takes text, `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, the four arrows, `Home` / `End` and `PageUp` / `PageDown`. None of those are rebindable, because in a text buffer they are text: only `close` (`Esc`) and `open_editor` (`Ctrl+e`) live under `[tui.keys.modal.note]`. Long lines scroll rather than wrap, so the caret always sits on the character it will push; `Ctrl+e` is the answer for prose that needs the width.

A note is what only you can write down: what you had just figured out, what is blocking, what to check before opening the PR. gwm already knows the branch, the linked issue, the diff against base and the agent session, and none of that says where you were.

The table carries a `≡` marker on the rows that have a note. It is deliberately binary, one glyph, one colour, no preview and no length: this row carries a note or it does not. The column only exists once at least one visible row has one, so a user who never writes a note keeps the exact table they had before.

- **Storage**: a plain Markdown file at `<main-checkout>/.git/gwm/notes/<branch>.md`, mirroring the `refs/heads/` layout, so a branch `feat/#515-notes` is `feat/#515-notes.md`. Greppable and editable with gwm shut down, never committed, readable from the main checkout, and it survives `gwm remove`. That last point is why it lives in the main checkout rather than inside the worktree: the note is usually still worth having between the removal and the merge.
- **Presence means non-blank.** A modal closed without typing leaves no file at all, and `$EDITOR` saved over an empty buffer leaves a single newline. Neither lights the marker.
- **Keyed on the branch**, with five consequences worth stating. A row on a detached HEAD has no branch to key on and says so in the status bar rather than doing nothing. A [rename](/tui/keybindings) (`c`) moves the note with the branch. And a branch name git accepts but no filesystem can back (`< > " |`, a component ending in `.`, a reserved device name like `CON`) carries no note, refused out loud rather than written under a name that means a different branch on another platform. And a rename onto a name that already carries a note is refused before anything moves: `git branch -m` would have rejected an existing branch, so that note is an orphan from a previous branch of the same name, and prose nothing can regenerate is not something to lose to a name reuse. And two branch names a volume folds together (`feat/foo` and `feat/Foo` on macOS or Windows, or an accented name against its differently-cased twin) share one file, so `N` refuses the pair by name rather than opening one branch's editor on the other's prose.
- **Lifecycle**: the note lives as long as the branch, and `gwm doctor` reports the ones whose branch is gone. Not `gwm clean`, whose stated safety property is that `--yes` only removes directories git already ignores; deleting prose under it would contradict that.

Read one from the CLI with [`gwm note show`](/cli/reference#gwm-note-show-slug-issue-515), or off the `--format=json` list rows, which carry the text in an additive `note` field.

`N` was unbound before [#515](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/515). If your `.gwm.toml` binds a chord _starting_ with `N` (say `top = ["N x"]`), that is now a prefix conflict against a shipped default and is refused at load time: rebind it, or move `edit_note` somewhere else.

## Confirm-delete overlay

The overlay shows two selectable buttons, `[ Confirm ]` / `[ Cancel ]`,
with focus defaulting to **Cancel**, the safe choice for a destructive
action, so a stray `Enter` cancels rather than deletes. The classic
`y` / `n` shortcuts still work regardless of focus.

| Key         | Verb (`[tui.keys.modal.confirm]`)                                                                              |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `←` / `h`   | focus `[ Confirm ]` (`focus_confirm`)                                                                          |
| `→` / `l`   | focus `[ Cancel ]` (`focus_cancel`)                                                                            |
| `Tab`       | toggle focus between the two buttons (`toggle_focus`; defaults to Cancel)                                      |
| `Enter`     | activate the focused button (`activate`; Confirm → delete · Cancel → dismiss)                                  |
| `y`         | confirm (`confirm`; classic) or arm the countdown (when `D` is armed, see [countdown](/tui/confirm-countdown)) |
| `y` again   | during an armed countdown, **disarms** it without firing                                                       |
| `n` / `Esc` | cancel (`cancel`)                                                                                              |

While the safety countdown is armed an animated spinner sits beside the
progress bar as a live loader.

## Create / rename overlay

Both the New Worktree form (`n`) and the rename form (`c`) share the same
`[tui.keys.modal.create]` verbs:

| Key                     | Verb (`[tui.keys.modal.create]`)                                                                        |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Tab`                   | next field (`next_field`)                                                                               |
| `BackTab` (`Shift+Tab`) | previous field (`prev_field`)                                                                           |
| `↑` / `←` / `h`         | previous worktree type (`prev_type`; on the type field)                                                 |
| `↓` / `→` / `l`         | next worktree type (`next_type`; on the type field)                                                     |
| `Ctrl+t`                | toggle structured ↔ free-form naming (`toggle_mode`)                                                    |
| `Enter`                 | submit and bootstrap / rename (`submit`; subject to the [TOFU trust gate](/configuration/trust-ledger)) |
| `Esc`                   | cancel (`cancel`)                                                                                       |

`Ctrl+t` flips the New Worktree form between the `<type>/#<issue>-<desc>` triple and a single free-form `Name` field ([#416](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/416)). Free-form mode drops the type selector and the issue field (it has no notion of either) and validates the name on submit rather than per keystroke, so an intermediate state can be typed through. Both sides keep what you typed, so toggling to look at the other form loses nothing. What a free-form worktree gives up is listed in [CLI → free-form naming](/cli/reference#free-form-naming---name).

The binding is Ctrl-modified on purpose: the create overlay reserves unmodified printable keys for its text fields, so a bare letter would be swallowed while typing a description.

It works in the rename form too ([#479](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/479)). It used to be inert there, because that form rendered and submitted the triple only, so toggling would have typed into a field it never showed; the form now has both modes, so the verb does what its name says.

A worktree created with `gwm create --name` opens the rename form in **free-form mode** with its current branch prefilled, instead of being turned away as it was before. `Ctrl+t` then moves between the two shapes in either direction, which is what makes the four renames possible:

| from       | to         | branch becomes                         | directory becomes                    |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| free-form  | free-form  | the name, verbatim                     | the name, with `/` flattened to `-`  |
| free-form  | structured | `branch_pattern` applied to the triple | `path_pattern` applied to the triple |
| structured | free-form  | the name, verbatim                     | the name, with `/` flattened to `-`  |
| structured | structured | unchanged                              | unchanged                            |

Toggling seeds only what is still empty, so a round trip never overwrites what you typed. Leaving structured seeds the name with the current branch verbatim. Leaving free-form seeds the description with a kebab-cased form of the name, capped at the same length the field accepts when typed, and leaves the issue empty because a free-form name carries no issue number. The **type** is neither seeded nor blanked: it stays on whatever the selector shows, which is the first configured type on a form you just opened, exactly as in the New Worktree form. It is visible in the selector and the preview spells out the branch it produces, so read that line before submitting if you are promoting a spike into the pattern.

Names are validated with exactly the rules `gwm create --name` uses, so a name one form refuses the other refuses too. The **main worktree** is never renamed from here: its branch is the repo's default branch, and `git worktree move` cannot move the main checkout anyway.

If the repo's `.gwm.toml` isn't trusted, `Enter` lands the form's status bar on a refuse message instead of running the bootstrap: the worktree directory is **not** created in that case, so you can fix the trust state in another terminal (`gwm bootstrap` from CLI, or set `GWM_ALLOW_BOOTSTRAP=1` and relaunch) and retry. See [Configuration → TOFU trust ledger](/configuration/trust-ledger#tui-behaviour) for the exact wording and full decision tree.

## Settings panel (`4`)

`4` opens the in-TUI Settings panel. Tabs (`Tab` / `Shift+Tab`) split it into
`Theme`, `Worktree`, `TUI`, `Keys` and the read-only `All` resolved-config
view. `L` flips the edit layer between the project `.gwm.toml` and the
user-global config; the layer selector decides which file an edit writes.

| Key               | Action                                                      |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab` / `BackTab` | next / previous tab                                         |
| `↑` / `↓`         | select a field / binding (scrolls on the `All` tab)         |
| `L`               | toggle the edit layer (project ↔ global)                    |
| `Space` / `Enter` | activate: cycle a choice, edit a value, or **rebind a key** |
| `Esc` / `q`       | close                                                       |

### Keys tab: live keymap editor

The `Keys` tab lists **every** rebindable binding: the global list-view
actions (`[global]`) and every modal verb grouped by context
(`[modal.<context>]`), each with its current key(s) and a `default` / `user` /
`repo` source badge. Select a binding and press the activate key (`Space` /
`Enter`) to capture a new key. The key column becomes a `[ … ]` input:

| Key         | Action                                                                        |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| any key     | record it into the binding                                                    |
| `Enter`     | commit a multi-stroke global chord (modal verbs auto-commit on the first key) |
| `Backspace` | drop the last captured stroke (global chord)                                  |
| `Esc`       | cancel the capture, leaving the binding unchanged                             |

The capture writes the binding as a TOML array to the targeted layer
(`[tui.keys]` for a global action, `[tui.keys.modal.<context>]` for a modal
verb), validates it (a conflict / prefix-collision aborts the write and leaves
the previous binding live), and reloads the keymap so the new key works
immediately. An empty capture (`Enter` with nothing recorded, global only)
unbinds the action. `Esc`, `Enter`, `Backspace` and `Ctrl+C` can't themselves
be assigned via capture: hand-edit `.gwm.toml` for those (see
[`[tui.keys]`](/configuration/gwm-toml#tuikeys)).

## Issue / PR link prompt (`i`)

The first stage (`[tui.keys.modal.link.choose_target]`) is a navigable
issue-or-PR chooser; the second (`[tui.keys.modal.link.input_number]`) takes the
number.

| Stage         | Key       | Verb                          |
| :------------ | :-------- | :---------------------------- |
| target choice | `j` / `↓` | next target (`next`)          |
| target choice | `k` / `↑` | previous target (`prev`)      |
| target choice | `i`       | select issue (`issue`)        |
| target choice | `p`       | select PR (`pr`)              |
| target choice | `Enter`   | confirm the target (`accept`) |
| target choice | `Esc`     | cancel (`cancel`)             |
| number input  | digits    | type the issue / PR number    |
| number input  | `Enter`   | commit the link (`submit`)    |
| number input  | `Esc`     | cancel (`cancel`)             |

## Issue / PR open menu (`B`)

| Key                   | Verb (`[tui.keys.modal.open_menu]`)            |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `j` / `k` / `↓` / `↑` | move between issue and PR (`toggle`)           |
| `i`                   | open the linked issue in the browser (`issue`) |
| `p`                   | open the linked PR in the browser (`pr`)       |
| `Enter`               | open the highlighted target (`accept`)         |
| `Esc` / `q`           | dismiss (`close`)                              |

## Exec picker overlay (`x`)

Lists the `[exec.profiles.*]` names; `Enter` resolves the highlight to its
`command` array and runs it (**with no shell**) in an embedded PTY overlay
rooted at the selected worktree (the same overlay `l` / `r` use). Refuses to
open with a status-bar hint when no `[exec.profiles]` are configured. Unlike
the CLI `gwm exec --workspace`, the overlay runs the profile in the **single**
selected worktree (one PTY cannot fan out).

| Key       | Verb (`[tui.keys.modal.exec]`)         |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `j` / `↓` | next profile (`next`)                  |
| `k` / `↑` | previous profile (`prev`)              |
| `Enter`   | run the highlighted profile (`accept`) |
| `Esc`     | cancel (`cancel`)                      |

## Clean overlay (`X`)

Previews the reclaimable build artifacts in the selected worktree and deletes
them on confirmation. The scan is gated by the **exact** safety check
`gwm clean --yes` uses: only directories git treats as ignored **and** holding
no tracked files are counted; anything else is listed as _skipped_ and never
touched. The picker always opens on a `(default)` choice, the set `gwm clean`
resolves with no `--profile` (the built-in `target` / `node_modules` / `dist` /
`build`, or `[clean.profiles.default]` when defined), followed by any
configured `[clean.profiles]`; `j` / `k` cycle them, re-scanning each time. The
confirm key arms the same safety countdown as
the [delete-confirm overlay](/tui/confirm-countdown) (driven by
`[tui] confirm_countdown_secs`); a second confirm or `Esc` disarms it, and the
reclaim fires automatically when the countdown elapses.

> The scan runs **synchronously** when the overlay opens, so opening it on a
> very large `target/` can briefly block the UI while the sizes are computed.
> Moving the scan onto the off-thread spine (#231) is a follow-up.

| Key           | Verb (`[tui.keys.modal.clean]`)    |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `j` / `↓`     | next profile (`next`)              |
| `k` / `↑`     | previous profile (`prev`)          |
| `y` / `Enter` | arm / fire the reclaim (`confirm`) |
| `n` / `Esc`   | cancel / disarm (`cancel`)         |

## Agent sessions overlay (`a`)

Lists every AI-agent session attached to the selected worktree: one row per
session, most recent first, with the agent, its freshness (**active** =
artefact activity in the last 5 minutes, **idle** otherwise), a
human-readable last-activity time and the session's **name** (Claude
Code's own live-session name when the session is running, else its first
prompt; Codex's thread name, taken from `session_index.jsonl` so a rename shows,
else its first prompt; opencode's session title from `opencode.db`;
Vibe's recorded title), falling back to the full session id when the
artefacts carry no name. Detection reads each agent's on-disk session
artefacts (Claude Code, Codex, opencode, Mistral Vibe): no process
enumeration, same code path on Linux, macOS and Windows (one Unix
refinement: a Claude Code session whose recorded PID is gone drops to
idle immediately). A worktree
with no session opens the overlay with an explicit _no agent session found_
row rather than a blank modal.

Rows are selectable: `j` / `k` move the highlight (the window follows, with
a scrollbar when the list overflows), `a` **pins** the selected session to
the worktree and `d` removes the pin, the same manual override as
`gwm agents attach` / `detach` (auto-detection stays the default). The
pinned session is marked `pinned` on its row.

The same detection feeds the **AGENT** column of the worktree table (the most
recently active agent, coloured by freshness) and an `Agent:` summary line in
the [details sidebar](/tui/sidebar)'s Worktree block. Detection runs
off-thread and re-checks every 30 seconds; sessions older than 30 days are
not scanned.

## CI checks overlay (`C`)

Lists every `statusCheckRollup` entry of the linked PR: one row per check,
rollup order, the state icon coloured with the same theme roles as the
sidebar's CI indicator (passing / failing / running) and the check name,
plus a right-aligned muted detail column with the owning workflow and the
run duration (elapsed time with an ellipsis while the check is in flight).
Opens from anywhere in the list view with `C`, or with `c` while the status
pane holds the focus (the same contextual dispatch that turns `j` / `k`
into sidebar scroll). The PR line's CI indicator advertises that key
(`… CI passing 10/10 [c]`). With no linked PR or an empty rollup, nothing
opens and the status bar explains why.

## PR / issue view (`I`)

Opens the linked pull request on everything the Status pane cannot fit: a
metadata block (state, author, `head` to `base` branch pair, diff size, CI
rollup, last update, URL), then the description, the submitted reviews with
their verdict, and the conversation. With no PR linked it opens the linked
**issue** instead, on the same shell minus the PR-only blocks. The metadata
and the conversation cost nothing on top of what the status refresh already
asks for, so that part is as fresh as the last `f`. With neither side
fetched, nothing opens and the status bar names the way out.

The **inline comments**, the ones anchored to a diff hunk, are the one thing
the view fetches for itself: on GitHub they are reachable through GraphQL
only, so they travel on a second request fired when the view opens. Each
thread renders as its anchor (`src/tui/app.rs:7-11`, plus `resolved` or
`outdated` when it applies), the diff hunk it hangs from, then the reply
chain. Hunk lines are truncated rather than wrapped, because a wrapped `+`
line's continuation would carry no sigil and read as context, and a long
hunk drops its head rather than its tail since the anchored line is the
last one. While the request is in flight the section says so, and a failed
one shows the error instead of going quiet.

Bodies are wrapped to the modal width and re-wrapped when the terminal is
resized. Long content is capped and the cut is explicit (`... 312 more
lines`, `… 4 more comments`): the `url` row and each comment header keep
their permalink, so `Enter` opens the full thread in the browser. Text
coming from the forge is neutralised before it is painted, so a control or
bidi character in a comment cannot reorder or overwrite what is on screen.

On a GitLab remote the view renders the summary tier plus the description,
the author and the branch pair. Approvals, notes and the diff size each
need a separate API call and are deliberately not fetched, so those
sections are absent rather than shown empty. The inline comments section is
the exception: it is present and says the backend cannot reach them, since
"gwm cannot show these here" and "this merge request has none" are different
facts and only one of them is true.

| `j` / `k` (`↓` / `↑`) | move the selection (`select_next` / `select_prev`)                     |

| `f`                   | re-fetch and refresh the view in place (`refresh`)                     |

## Help overlay (`?`)

Keys render as coloured **badges** (the same chip style as the bottom
statusline) with themed section headers, so a binding stands out from
its description. All colours follow the resolved `[theme]`.

The overlay documents **every** key context: the global and list-view
actions, then one section per modal overlay (Create Form, Delete
Worktree, Browse Links, Link Prompt, Command Palette, Exec Profiles,
Clean Reclaim, Agent Sessions, CI Checks, PR / Issue View, Command Logs, Settings,
Bootstrap Report, the PTY escape hatch, and the overlay's own
navigation). Every modal verb resolves live against
`[tui.keys.modal.<context>]`, so a rebind shows through and an
explicitly unbound verb renders `(unbound)`. A completeness test pins
the whole surface: a new verb cannot land undocumented.

| Key                          | Action               |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------- |
| `j` / `k` (`Down` / `Up`)    | scroll               |
| `h` / `l` (`Left` / `Right`) | pan                  |
| `g` / `G` (`Home` / `End`)   | jump to top / bottom |
| `Esc` / `q` / `?` / `Enter`  | dismiss              |

## V0.10 rebind summary

The [#290](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/290) keymap redesign moved
several keys to make room for the new verbs. The biggest changes to relearn:

| Pre-v0.10                           | v0.10+             | Why                                                                                                                                                      |

| `v` / `V` (sidebar toggle / layout) | `V` / `Space`      | `V` toggles the sidebar, `Space` cycles layout (moved to `z` in [#484](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/484), where `Space` became the row mark) |
| `y` (yank path)                     | `Y`                | `y` now yanks the **branch name**; `Y` yanks the path; `w` yanks the slug                                                                                |
| `R` (review)                        | `r` / `R`          | `r` runs the review in a PTY overlay, `R` runs it fullscreen                                                                                             |

Existing `[tui.keys]` overrides written with the old slugs (`git_tui`,
`review`, `yank`, `open`, `open_menu`, …) keep working through backward-compat
aliases; only the physical defaults moved.

## V0.6 rebind summary

Three keys moved when [#75 (configurable launchers)](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/75) landed. Update muscle memory accordingly:

| Pre-v0.6 | v0.6+ | Why                                                                                     |
| :------- | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r`      | `f`   | `r` kept as **alias** for muscle memory, but the documented mnemonic is now `f`         |
| `R`      | `F`   | freed `R` for the new review launcher; `F` does the GitHub refresh `R` used to do       |
| _(none)_ | `R`   | launch the configured `[review]` command (lumen / claude / codex / aider / gh / custom) |

If you wired any of these into a custom script (unlikely, they're TUI-only), nothing breaks; this is purely about the in-app overlay.
