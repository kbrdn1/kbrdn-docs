![Confirm-delete overlay with the armed safety countdown](../../../assets/captures/countdown.gif)

The `d` confirm overlay has two modes, picked automatically based on whether `D` (toggle "delete branch on remove") was pressed earlier in the session.

## Classic mode: `delete branch on remove` OFF

Single keystroke:

- `y` / `Enter` → fires the delete immediately.
- `n` / `Esc` → cancels.

Same as the pre-#30 behaviour. Removing a worktree without dropping its branch is cheap (just an entry in `.git/worktrees/`) and the branch survives, so there's nothing to safeguard against.

## Countdown mode: `delete branch on remove` ON

When `D` is armed, the overlay shows the branch about to disappear plus a two-stage `arm` step:

1. `y` (or `Enter` on the focused `[ Confirm ]` button) → **arms** a safety countdown (default 3s, visualised by a progress bar with an animated spinner beside it as a live loader).
2. The actual delete fires once the bar fills.
3. `y` again **during** the countdown disarms it without firing.
4. `Esc` / `n` cancels at any time, armed or not.

The reasoning: dropping a branch is **destructive** (the branch is gone from `git branch`, only `git reflog` can resurrect it). The countdown forces a sub-second pause where you can change your mind, especially useful when muscle memory says `dyy` and you didn't notice `D` was still armed from earlier in the session.

## Configuration

The countdown duration is configurable via `[tui].confirm_countdown_secs` in `.gwm.toml`. Accepted range: `0..=5`.

```toml
[tui]
# 3s default. Set to 0 to disable the countdown (classic modal even when D is armed).
confirm_countdown_secs = 3
```

- `0` → keeps the classic single-keystroke modal even when `delete branch on remove` is armed.
- `1..=5` → the visualised countdown length, in seconds.
- Values above `5` are silently clamped to `5` on read.

See [Configuration → `.gwm.toml` schema](/configuration/gwm-toml#tui) for the full `[tui]` block.
