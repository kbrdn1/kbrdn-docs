Added by [#87](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/87) / [#165](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/pull/165) (keymap) and [#32](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/32) / [#167](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/pull/167) (palette); extended to remappable **modal keys** by [#219](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/219) and an in-TUI **Keys editor** by [#294](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/294).

The TUI's list-view bindings are not fixed: every action is addressable by a slug, you can rebind it, and you can also fire it by name from a command palette. Both surfaces share one underlying `Action` dispatcher, so they can never drift on which verbs exist or how they behave.

## Remappable keymap (`[tui.keys]`)

The `[tui.keys]` block in `.gwm.toml` rebinds any list-view action with crossterm-grammar keys, including **multi-key chords** like `g g`:

```toml
[tui.keys]
down = ["j", "Down"]
top  = ["g g"]        # chord: press g, then g
quit = ["q", "Q"]
```

Each action keeps its built-in default unless you override it. The bindings shown in [Keybindings](/tui/keybindings) are those defaults.

### Load-time validation

Overrides are validated when the config loads. These are hard errors, surfaced before the TUI opens:

- **unknown action**: a key the slug table doesn't recognise.
- **parse error**: a key string crossterm can't parse.
- **chord conflict**: two actions bound to the same chord.
- **prefix collision**: one binding is a prefix of another (`g` would shadow `g g`).

`gwm doctor` additionally flags a keymap that leaves `quit` unbound, so you can't lock yourself out of the TUI.

### Inspecting the resolved keymap

`gwm tui keys` prints the resolved keymap (built-in defaults layered with your `[tui.keys]` overrides), one row per action, with a per-row **source** column so you can tell a default from an override:

```
action            keys              source
```

The action column lists the slugs accepted in `[tui.keys]`; the keys column shows every chord bound to that action (comma-separated); an empty keys cell means the action is currently unbound.

The `?` help overlay is built from this same resolved keymap, so the in-app documentation always matches your actual bindings rather than the defaults.

`gwm tui keys` also prints the modal keymap (one block per context, see below), and `gwm doctor` re-reads the on-disk config and reports per-context conflicts.

## Rebindable modal keys

Added by [#219](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/219). The keys _inside_ the overlays (the create / rename form, the delete-confirm modal, the link prompt, the Settings panel, the Command Logs overlay, the help overlay, the issue/PR open menu, the command palette, and the bootstrap report) are no longer hard-coded. Each overlay is a **context** with its own typed **verbs**, remapped under a nested `[tui.keys.modal.<context>]` sub-table:

```toml
[tui.keys.modal.confirm]
confirm = ["y"]
cancel  = ["n", "Esc"]

[tui.keys.modal.create]
submit     = ["Enter"]
next_field = ["Tab"]
```

The `modal` namespace is deliberately separate from the global `[tui.keys]` table, so a context can't collide with a same-named global action. A global `create` array and a modal `[tui.keys.modal.create]` table coexist:

```toml
[tui.keys]
create = ["n"]            # global: open the New Worktree form

[tui.keys.modal.create]   # inside that form: the field-navigation verbs
submit = ["Enter"]
```

Rules and conventions:

- **Single keystrokes only.** Unlike global actions, a modal verb takes one key per binding: a multi-stroke chord is rejected at load time.
- **Same key, different meaning.** Because each context resolves independently, the same physical key can mean different things across modals: `Enter` is `submit` in the create form but `activate` in the delete-confirm modal.
- **Two-stage surfaces use a dotted path**: `[tui.keys.modal.link.choose_target]`, `[tui.keys.modal.link.input_number]`, and `[tui.keys.modal.config.edit]`.
- **Reserved keys can't be assigned.** `Ctrl+C`, the list view's contextual `Esc` / `Enter`, and the PTY overlay's emergency `Esc` stay hard-coded by design.

`gwm tui keys` lists every context and verb with its resolved keys and source; `gwm doctor` validates the contextual bindings against the on-disk config. The Keybindings help overlay and the statusbar footer hints resolve modal keys from the override layer too, so they always match your config rather than fixed strings. See the per-overlay tables in [Keybindings](/tui/keybindings).

You can edit any of these (global _and_ modal) without touching `.gwm.toml` by hand, from the **Keys tab** of the [Settings panel](/tui/keybindings#settings-panel-4) (`4`): select a binding, press the activate key, and capture a new key live; the capture writes the TOML array to the targeted layer, validates it, and reloads the keymap on the spot.

## User macros (`[tui.macro1]` / `[tui.macro2]`)

[#290](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/290) added two user-defined commands fired straight from the worktree list (`h` runs `macro_one`, `H` runs `macro_two`), each running in the selected worktree's directory:

```toml
[tui.macro1]
command = "cargo clean"

[tui.macro2]
command = "cargo install --path ."
open_in = "pty"          # "pty" (default, embedded overlay) or "mux_pane"
```

`open_in` defaults to `"pty"` (an embedded [PTY overlay](/tui/launchers#the-embedded-pty-overlay-l--r), TUI suspends until exit); set it to `"mux_pane"` to launch the command in a new tmux / zellij pane instead. The `h` / `H` bindings are themselves rebindable as the `macro_one` / `macro_two` actions in `[tui.keys]`.

## Command palette

Press `:` (rebindable as `command_palette` in `[tui.keys]`) to open the command palette. Type to **fuzzy-filter** the registered actions (`:create`, `:bootstrap`, `:yank-path`, and the rest of the list-view verbs):

| Key               | Action                              |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| _(type)_          | fuzzy-filter the registered actions |
| `Enter`           | fire the highlighted action         |
| `Tab` / `↓` / `↑` | cycle the highlight                 |
| `Esc`             | cancel                              |

Each palette entry is a stable verb (`name`) plus a one-line description; the names are what you type after `:`. Because the palette and the keystroke dispatcher resolve through the **same `Action` dispatcher**, every keybinding has a palette twin and vice versa: the two surfaces can never disagree on which verbs are addressable or what they do.
