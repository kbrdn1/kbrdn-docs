Added by [#67](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/67) / [#68](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/pull/68); refined in v0.6 by [#75](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/75).

Every worktree can be linked to a GitHub issue and / or pull request. The link drives the live `Issue / PR` block in the [TUI sidebar](/tui/sidebar#issue--pr-block) and surfaces in `gwm status` for scripting.

::: tip
Since [#419](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/419) this page describes the **GitHub** backend. The storage model, auto-detection and TUI surfaces below are forge-agnostic and apply unchanged to GitLab. See [GitLab (multi-forge)](/integrations/gitlab) for what differs.

## Storage model

Links live in **git config**, scoped to the branch, never in a file gwm owns:

- `git config branch.<name>.gwm-issue`: the linked issue number
- `git config branch.<name>.gwm-pr`: the linked PR number

Alongside the explicit links, gwm caches the **auto-detected PR** and the fetched titles / states so the no-fetch read paths (`gwm list`, the TUI table at startup) can colour the issue / PR pastilles without a per-row `gh` call:

- `git config branch.<name>.gwm-pr-detected`: the auto-detected PR number ([#283](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/283))
- `git config branch.<name>.gwm-pr-detected-title` / `.gwm-pr-detected-state`: the cached title / state of the detected PR
- `git config branch.<name>.gwm-issue-title` / `.gwm-issue-state`: the cached title / state of the linked issue
- `git config branch.<name>.gwm-pr-title` / `.gwm-pr-state`: the cached title / state of the explicitly-linked PR

This means:

- The link **survives worktree moves** (`gwm` rewriting `.git/worktrees/<name>/HEAD` doesn't touch branch config).
- The link is **per-branch, local**: not committed, not pushed, not shared with the repo's other clones.
- `git config --unset branch.<name>.gwm-issue` is a 100% valid alternative to `gwm unlink issue`.

## Auto-detection

Branches following the gwm naming convention `<type>/#<N>-<slug>` derive the issue number from the branch name, with zero config needed.

```
feat/#42-user-auth          → issue #42 auto-linked
fix/#117-leak               → issue #117 auto-linked
chore/#5-rename             → issue #5 auto-linked
release-1.x                 → no auto-link (no #N pattern)
```

PR numbers have no branch-name convention, so they are detected a different way: [#181](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/181) added **PR auto-detection**. When a branch has no explicit PR link, gwm asks GitHub which PR was opened from it (`gh pr list --head <branch> --state all`) and surfaces it marked `detected`:

```
$ gwm status --json | jq '.pr.source'
"detected"          # vs "explicit" for a `gwm link pr`, "branch-name" for issues
```

The `source` field carries the link's provenance: `"branch-name"` (derived from the `<type>/#<N>-<slug>` convention, issues only), `"explicit"` (a recorded `gwm link`), `"detected"` (`LinkSource::Detected`, auto-detected from `gh`, resolved live on a fetch or read from the persisted cache), or `"none"`.

Detection is **persisted** ([#283](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/283)): once a probe succeeds, the detected number (plus its title / state) is cached in git config under `branch.<name>.gwm-pr-detected`. The cache is what lets the no-fetch read paths (`gwm list`, the TUI table at startup) colour the PR pastille on every row without a per-row `gh` call. The persisted cache never overrides an explicit link: `read_link` resolves the PR in this order:

1. an explicit `gwm link pr` (`gwm-pr`), which always wins,
2. then the persisted auto-detection (`gwm-pr-detected`),
3. then nothing.

The cache stays honest because the **live-detection paths reconcile it on refresh**: a successful re-probe rewrites the stored number, and an empty result clears it, so a stale number is never resurrected after the PR was closed or replaced. A `gh` failure (not installed, no network) leaves the cache untouched, so the last-known detection survives the failed probe. `gwm unlink pr` drops the persisted detection too, so unlinking doesn't leave a `gwm-pr-detected` number that would resurface as a `detected` PR.

Because each fresh lookup is a `gh` call, live detection runs only where it is cheap or asked for:

- **`gwm status`**: always (one worktree); reconciles the cache.
- **TUI sidebar**: on the `F` refresh (one selected worktree, deduped). A detected PR is tagged ` (detected)` so it reads apart from an explicit link.
- **`gwm list --detect-pr`**: opt-in flag; adds a `PR` column at the cost of one `gh` call per worktree, and reconciles the cache for each. Plain `gwm list` stays network-free, reading the persisted cache to colour the pastilles.

To pin a durable, explicit link instead (e.g. a PR not opened from this branch's head):

```bash
gwm link pr 61
```

## Explicit linking

```bash
# Link the current (CWD) worktree
gwm link issue 42
gwm link pr 61

# Link a fuzzy-matched worktree from anywhere
gwm link issue 42 --worktree feat-auth

# Remove an explicit override (auto-detect resurfaces for issues)
gwm unlink issue
gwm unlink pr

# Open the link in the browser via the OS opener
gwm open issue
gwm open pr --print-url        # print the URL on stdout instead

# Inspect the current state
gwm status                     # human-readable
gwm status --json              # stable schema for scripts
```

## Live status via `gh`

`gwm status` (and the TUI's `F` key) shells out to `gh issue view` and `gh pr view` to fetch state, title, labels, and CI rollup:

```
$ gwm status
Issue #42 [open] TUI: fuzzy search
PR #61 [draft] · checks 2/3
```

| Bracketed value | Source                               |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `[open]`        | `gh`'s `state`                       |
| `[closed]`      | `gh`'s `state`                       |
| `[merged]`      | `gh`'s `state` (PR only)             |
| `[draft]`       | `gh`'s `isDraft` (PR only)           |
| `checks N/M`    | `gh`'s `statusCheckRollup` (PR only) |

Without `gh` (or outside a repo with a GitHub remote), gwm degrades gracefully: only the local link is shown, no error:

```
$ gwm status
Issue #42 (gh not available — local link only)
```

## TUI surface

In the worktree list view, the right details panel renders a **live `Issue / PR` block** for the selected worktree (hidden when nothing is linked). Three keybindings drive it:

| Key | Action                                                                     |
| :-- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `O` | open menu (`i` open issue in browser, `p` open PR in browser)              |
| `L` | link prompt (`i` issue or `p` pr → type the number → Enter to commit)      |
| `F` | refresh the GitHub status (synchronous `gh` fetch, updates the status bar) |

> The `F` keybinding was `R` pre-v0.6, rebound by [#75](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/75) when `R` was claimed by the [review launcher](/tui/launchers). See [Keybindings → v0.6 rebind summary](/tui/keybindings#v06-rebind-summary).

The `Issue / PR` block is **rebuilt on every selection change**, so navigating with `j` / `k` never surfaces stale data from the previously selected worktree.

## Sidebar header status dot

The header `● <worktree-name>` line carries a coloured `●` that tracks the linked PR / issue state:

- **green**: open
- **gray**: draft
- **magenta**: merged
- **red**: closed
- **darkgray**: nothing linked / unknown state

The dot is rebuilt from cached `gh` fetch state on every frame, so it follows live status without invalidating the rest of the sidebar's git-preview cache. Hit `F` to force a refresh.

## URL derivation

gwm derives the issue / PR URL from the repo's GitHub remote:

```
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<N>
```

The owner/repo extraction handles a few quirks:

- Trailing `/` on the remote URL (`https://github.com/owner/repo.git/`), fixed in #68 by Copilot's review; the `.git` suffix is now stripped after normalising trailing slashes.
- SSH form (`git@github.com:owner/repo.git`), parsed identically.

If the remote is not GitHub, `gwm open` exits with an error rather than guessing a URL.
