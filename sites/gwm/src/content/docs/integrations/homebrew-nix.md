gwm ships through several managed channels in addition to `cargo install`: Homebrew, Nix, `cargo binstall`, and the raw prebuilt archives. Pick whichever fits your environment. End-user install instructions live in [Getting Started → Install](/getting-started/install); this page covers the **packaging surface** for contributors, maintainers, and downstream packagers.

## Homebrew tap

Tap and formula:

- Tap: [`kbrdn1/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/homebrew-tap)
- Formula: `Formula/gwm.rb`
- Canonical source: [`packaging/homebrew/gwm.rb.template`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/packaging/homebrew/gwm.rb.template) in this repo

The tap is refreshed **automatically on every stable release** by the `homebrew-tap-update` job in [`release.yml`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). The job:

1. Reads the freshly-tagged version (e.g. `v0.6.0`).
2. Filters out pre-release tags (`-rc.N`, `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`) so `brew install gwm` always resolves to a stable build. Pre-releases are still published to the GitHub releases page; they just don't update the tap.
3. Substitutes version, SHA, and archive URLs into the template.
4. Opens a PR (or pushes directly, depending on the tap's branch protection) against `kbrdn1/homebrew-tap`.

End-user install:

```bash
brew tap kbrdn1/tap
brew install gwm
```

## Nix flake

`flake.nix` lives at the repo root. The package is built via `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` and pins `Cargo.lock`; `git2`'s `vendored-libgit2` feature keeps the closure free of system libgit2.

End-user install:

```bash
# one-shot run, no clone
nix run github:kbrdn1/gwm-cli -- list

# install into your profile
nix profile install github:kbrdn1/gwm-cli

# in a NixOS / nix-darwin config, via the overlay
nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.gwm.overlays.default ];
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.gwm ];
```

The flake exports:

- `packages.<system>.gwm`: the executable
- `packages.<system>.default`: alias for `gwm`
- `apps.<system>.default`: `nix run` entry point
- `overlays.default`: for downstream NixOS / nix-darwin configs
- `devShells.<system>.default`: pinned Rust toolchain + `rust-analyzer`, `clippy`, `rustfmt`, `cargo-watch`, `cargo-edit`, and the libgit2 build deps. Used by [Development → Testing](/development/testing).

Test the flake locally before pushing changes:

```bash
nix flake check
nix build .#gwm
./result/bin/gwm --version
```

## Cargo-binstall

Added by [#27](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/27) / [#173](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/pull/173). A `[package.metadata.binstall]` block in `Cargo.toml` lets [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) pull the prebuilt release archive instead of compiling from source:

```bash
cargo binstall gwm-cli
```

`cargo binstall` resolves the archive (`gwm-v{version}-{target}.tar.gz`, `.zip` on Windows) straight from the matching GitHub Release and unpacks the binary, with no Rust toolchain invocation and no libgit2 compile at install time, in contrast to `cargo install gwm-cli` which builds the crate locally.

The metadata pins the archive naming to the `release.yml` matrix output; `tests/binstall_metadata_tests.rs` guards against artefact-naming drift so a renamed asset can't silently break `cargo binstall`.

See [Getting Started → Install](/getting-started/install) for the end-user comparison of `cargo binstall` vs `cargo install` vs the prebuilt archives.

## Prebuilt binaries

Releases at <https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/releases> ship signed binaries with `.sha256` sidecars for:

- Linux (`x86_64`, `aarch64`)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Windows (`x86_64`)

The build matrix is the `release` workflow in [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). Each tag-push triggers a parallel build across the matrix, with `.sha256` sidecars computed in the same job. Release notes are sourced from the **per-version changelog** (`changelogs/<version>.md`), not from the root `CHANGELOG.md`, which only holds the current `[Unreleased]` section + index.

## The release pipeline at a glance

```
git tag v0.6.0 && git push origin v0.6.0
         ↓
.github/workflows/release.yml
    ├─ build matrix (5 targets)         → release assets + .sha256
    ├─ pre-release.yml gate              → skip on -rc / -alpha / -beta
    └─ homebrew-tap-update job           → only on stable tags
         ↓
github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/releases   ← binaries
github.com/kbrdn1/homebrew-tap        ← formula bump PR
```
