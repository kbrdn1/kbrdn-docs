title: User-level global config
description: ~/.config/gwm/config.toml, the same .gwm.toml schema, merged underneath every repo's config so a preference set once applies everywhere.

  order: 6

The same `.gwm.toml` schema may also live at a **user-level** location, applied to every repo on the machine. Set a preference once (a theme, a worktree base, a keymap) and every repo inherits it unless its own `.gwm.toml` overrides it (issue #190).

## Location

```
~/.config/gwm/config.toml
```

`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, when set, is honoured **outright** (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gwm/config.toml`): an explicit config home wins whether or not the file exists there. Otherwise gwm considers the cross-platform `~/.config/gwm/config.toml` and the platform config dir (`dirs::config_dir()`, so `Application Support` on macOS and `%APPDATA%` on Windows), and the **first that exists wins**; with neither present, `~/.config/gwm/config.toml` is the canonical location on every platform (issue #372; before it, macOS silently looked only under `Application Support`). It accepts the **identical schema** to `.gwm.toml`. See [`.gwm.toml` schema](/configuration/gwm-toml).

```toml
# ~/.config/gwm/config.toml
[theme]
preset = "catppuccin"

[tui]
sidebar_position = "left"
```

## Merge semantics

The global file is merged **underneath** each repo's `.gwm.toml` as a deep TOML overlay, then a single validation pass runs on the merged result. The repo always wins on conflict:

- **Scalars**: the repo value overrides the global value.
- **Tables** (`[theme]`, `[worktree]`, `[tui]`, …): merged **key-by-key** recursively, so disjoint sections from both files coexist and a nested override keeps the untouched sibling keys.
- **Arrays** (`[[labels]]`, `[[bootstrap.copy]]`, `[[milestones]]`, …): **replaced wholesale** by the repo when present. They are never element-wise unioned: a repo's `[[labels]]` fully supersedes the global set rather than producing a confusing concatenation.

In this example, global sets a theme and a couple of labels; the repo overrides one theme role and declares its own label set:

```toml
# ~/.config/gwm/config.toml
[theme]
preset = "catppuccin"
focus  = "#89b4fa"

[[labels]]
name = "global-label"
```

```toml
# <repo>/.gwm.toml
[theme]
focus = "cyan"        # scalar — repo wins

[[labels]]            # array — repo replaces the global set wholesale
name = "bug"
```

Resolved result: `theme.preset = "catppuccin"` (from global, untouched), `theme.focus = "cyan"` (repo wins on the conflicting scalar, the other catppuccin roles survive), and exactly one label `bug` (the global `global-label` is gone, because the array was replaced, not merged).

## No global file

With no global file present, loading is identical to before #190: repo-only, then the built-in default. The absent-global case is preserved byte-for-byte.

## Opting out

Set `GWM_NO_GLOBAL_CONFIG=1` to force strictly repo-only loading, ignoring any global file that happens to exist. CI uses this for deterministic runs so a runner's stray `~/.config/gwm/config.toml` can't perturb a build.

```bash
GWM_NO_GLOBAL_CONFIG=1 gwm list
```

## Validation

Validation (theme, keymap, aliases, labels, bootstrap guards, …) runs on the **merged** result, not on each layer in isolation, so a global preset combined with a repo override is checked as the user will actually see it. The same load-time errors apply ([`.gwm.toml` schema → validation rules](/configuration/gwm-toml#validation-rules)).
