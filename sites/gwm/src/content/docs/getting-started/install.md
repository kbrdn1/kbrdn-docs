gwm ships a single self-contained binary. Pick whichever channel fits your workflow - they all produce the same `gwm` executable.

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli.git
cd gwm-cli
cargo install --path .
```

The binary lands in `~/.cargo/bin/gwm`. Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain - MSRV is **1.95**.

## From crates.io

```bash
cargo install gwm-cli
```

The crate is published as [`gwm-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/gwm-cli) - the bare `gwm` name on crates.io is an unrelated third-party project - and still installs the `gwm` command. This compiles from the published source (same toolchain / MSRV requirement as _from source_ above); use _via cargo-binstall_ below to skip the `git2` / vendored-libgit2 build entirely.

## Via cargo-binstall

```bash
cargo binstall gwm-cli
```

[`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) reads the `[package.metadata.binstall]` block in `gwm`'s `Cargo.toml`, downloads the prebuilt archive matching your host triple from the GitHub Release, extracts it, and drops the binary in `~/.cargo/bin/`. No Rust toolchain or `git2`/libgit2 C compile is needed at install time - much faster than `cargo install` on first run.

The metadata points at the same artefacts the release workflow publishes (`gwm-v{version}-{target}.tar.gz`, or `.zip` on Windows), so any tagged release is binstall-able. `tests/binstall_metadata_tests.rs` pins the block against drift.

## Via Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap kbrdn1/tap
brew install gwm
```

The formula lives at [`kbrdn1/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/homebrew-tap) (`Formula/gwm.rb`) and is refreshed automatically on every **stable** release of `gwm-cli` by the `homebrew-tap-update` job in [`release.yml`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml). The canonical formula template is at [`packaging/homebrew/gwm.rb.template`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/packaging/homebrew/gwm.rb.template). Pre-release tags (`-rc.N`, `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`) are filtered out, so `brew install gwm` always points at a stable build.

See [Integrations → Homebrew & Nix](/integrations/homebrew-nix) for the tap-update pipeline and the flake outputs in detail.

## Via Scoop (Windows)

```powershell
scoop bucket add gwm https://github.com/kbrdn1/scoop-gwm
scoop install gwm
```

The manifest lives at [`kbrdn1/scoop-gwm`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/scoop-gwm) (`bucket/gwm.json`) and is refreshed automatically on every **stable** release by the `scoop-bucket-update` job in [`release.yml`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) - the Windows counterpart of the Homebrew tap. The canonical template is at [`packaging/scoop/gwm.json.template`](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/packaging/scoop/gwm.json.template). Pre-release tags are filtered out, so `scoop install gwm` always points at a stable build. `scoop update gwm` picks up each new version once the release job pushes the refreshed `bucket/gwm.json` - the manifest's `autoupdate` block is maintainer-side metadata (consumed by Scoop's `checkver`/excavator tooling to regenerate the manifest), not what drives client-side updates.

## Prebuilt binaries

Releases at <https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/releases> ship signed binaries with `.sha256` sidecars for:

- Linux (`x86_64`, `aarch64`)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Windows (`x86_64`)

Drop the binary on your `$PATH`, mark it executable, and you're done.

## Debian / Ubuntu (`.deb`)

Every stable release ships `.deb` packages for `x86_64` (`amd64`) and `aarch64` (`arm64`), built by [`cargo-deb`](https://github.com/kornelski/cargo-deb) and attached to the [release](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/releases). Download the one for your architecture and install it:

```bash
# x86_64 — grab gwm-cli_<version>-1_amd64.deb from the releases page, then:
sudo apt install ./gwm-cli_<version>-1_amd64.deb
# aarch64 → gwm-cli_<version>-1_arm64.deb
```

Use `apt install ./…` (note the leading `./`) rather than `dpkg -i`: the package `Depends` on `git`, and `apt` pulls it automatically, whereas `dpkg -i` does not resolve dependencies and fails on a system that doesn't already have git.

The package is named **`gwm-cli`** and declares `Conflicts: gwm` - Debian ships an unrelated `gwm` X11 window manager that also owns `/usr/bin/gwm`, so the two can't be installed together (remove the window manager first if you happen to have it). The installed command is still `gwm`. The binary links only glibc dynamically (libgit2 and zlib are statically linked), and gwm shells out to the `git` binary at runtime - so `Depends: libc6 (>= 2.34), git`. The packages are built on `ubuntu-latest`, so they declare a glibc floor and install cleanly only on distributions at or above it (RHEL 8 and Ubuntu 20.04 are too old; use `cargo install` there). Each `.deb` has a `.sha256` sidecar for verification.

## Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE (`.rpm`)

Likewise, `.rpm` packages for `x86_64` and `aarch64` are built by [`cargo-generate-rpm`](https://github.com/cat-in-136/cargo-generate-rpm) and attached to every stable release:

```bash
# Fedora / RHEL (x86_64)
sudo dnf install ./gwm-cli-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm
# aarch64 → gwm-cli-<version>-1.aarch64.rpm
# openSUSE:
sudo zypper install ./gwm-cli-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Install via `dnf`/`zypper` (not `rpm -i`): the package `Requires: git`, and those resolve it automatically, whereas `rpm -i` does not pull dependencies and fails without git already installed.

## Arch Linux (AUR)

Arch and derivatives (Manjaro, EndeavourOS, …) install from the AUR via any helper:

```bash
yay -S gwm-cli-bin
# or: paru -S gwm-cli-bin
```

> [!WARNING]
> **`gwm-cli-bin` is maintained by a community contributor, not by this project.** It was submitted to the AUR independently, so gwm's release pipeline has no push rights on it and cannot refresh it. Its version can therefore lag behind a release: at the time of writing it sits at **1.5.0** while the current release is **1.6.0**.
>
> Nothing suggests bad faith - the package is correct in shape, points at this repository, and declares the right dependencies. But it is a build produced by a third party, which is worth knowing before installing. For the current version on Arch, use `cargo binstall gwm-cli` or a prebuilt tarball. Tracked in [#430](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/issues/430).

`gwm-cli-bin` is a **prebuilt-binary** package: it downloads the `x86_64` or `aarch64` linux-gnu tarball from the matching GitHub Release, verifies its `sha256`, and installs the `gwm` binary, the MIT license, and shell completions for bash/zsh/fish - no compilation, no Rust toolchain. It `provides`/`conflicts` both `gwm-cli` and `gwm` (it owns `/usr/bin/gwm`), so it won't co-install with a source build of the same tool.

This repository briefly shipped an `aur-publish` job meant to push a stable build on every release. It was removed: for the ownership reason above it could never push, so all it did was fail silently on every tag. The [`PKGBUILD` template](https://github.com/kbrdn1/gwm-cli/blob/main/packaging/aur/PKGBUILD.template) and its render script are still maintained and tested, and the AUR is now fed by hand like Nixpkgs and aqua.

## Via Nix flake

A `flake.nix` lives at the repo root. With flakes enabled:

```bash
# one-shot run, no clone
nix run github:kbrdn1/gwm-cli -- list

# install into your profile
nix profile install github:kbrdn1/gwm-cli

# in a NixOS / nix-darwin config, via the overlay
nixpkgs.overlays = [ inputs.gwm.overlays.default ];
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.gwm ];
```

The package is built via `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage` and pins `Cargo.lock`; `git2`'s `vendored-libgit2` feature keeps the closure free of system libgit2.

## Via aqua

[aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) is a declarative, version-pinned CLI version manager. gwm lives in the **standard registry**, so no custom registry wiring is needed:

```bash
# add the package to aqua.yaml and install it in one step
aqua g -i kbrdn1/gwm-cli

# or declare it yourself, then install
#   packages:
#     - name: kbrdn1/gwm-cli@v1.6.0
aqua i
```

aqua downloads the prebuilt binary for your platform from the matching GitHub Release and verifies its `sha256` against the `.sha256` sidecar published alongside it. No compilation, no Rust toolchain. Linux, macOS and Windows are all covered (Intel and ARM); Windows on ARM runs the x64 build under emulation.

The package requires **standard registry `v4.539.0` or newer**: that is the release that first shipped it. If `aqua g -i kbrdn1/gwm-cli` reports an unknown package, your `aqua.yaml` is pinned to an older registry `ref`; bump it.

## Verify the install

```bash
gwm --version
gwm doctor                     # run a battery of sanity checks
```

If `gwm doctor` returns non-zero, jump to [`gwm doctor`](/integrations/doctor) for the per-check remediation hints.
