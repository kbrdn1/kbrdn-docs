Inside an already-running multiplexer session, `gwm tmux`, `gwm zellij` and `gwm herdr` spawn a new window / pane / tab whose shell starts inside the matched worktree, with no manual `cd` round-trip needed.

## tmux

```bash
gwm tmux auth                    # new tmux window inside the matched worktree
gwm tmux auth -p                 # split the current pane instead
gwm tmux auth --split            # ...long form of -p
gwm tmux auth --direction down   # ...stacked rather than side by side
```

Under the hood:

- **new window** (default): `tmux new-window -n <name> -c <path>`
- **split** (`-p` / `--split`): `tmux split-window -h -c <path>`, or `-v` under `down`, plus `-b` under `left` / `up`

The `-n <name>` arg names the new window after the worktree slug so it stands out in the status bar.

`-h` is tmux's _horizontal split_, and it puts the new pane to the **right**; `-v` stacks it below. tmux names the axis the divider runs along, not where the pane goes, which is worth knowing before reading the two flags as the words suggest. `-b` ("before") flips the side on whichever axis was picked, so `left` is `-h -b` and `up` is `-v -b`. Measured on tmux 3.7c by reading the new pane's geometry back through `split-window -P -F`.

## zellij

```bash
gwm zellij auth                  # new zellij tab inside the matched worktree
gwm zellij auth -p               # new pane in the current tab instead
gwm zellij auth --direction down # ...stacked rather than side by side
```

Under the hood:

- **new tab** (default): `zellij action new-tab --name <name> --cwd <path>`
- **new pane** (`-p` / `--split`): `zellij action new-pane --direction <dir> --cwd <path>`

`--direction` is optional in zellij's own parser: without it, zellij "will try to use the biggest available space", which makes the pane's position a property of the current layout rather than of the command. gwm passes it so the answer is the same every time.

The `--cwd` flag on `new-tab` requires **zellij ≥ 0.40**; older versions error out. `new-pane --cwd` has been stable longer, so use `-p` if you're stuck on an older zellij.

## herdr

```bash
gwm herdr auth                   # new herdr tab inside the matched worktree
gwm herdr auth -p                # split the current pane instead
gwm herdr auth --direction down  # ...stacked rather than side by side
```

Under the hood:

- **new tab** (default): `herdr tab create --workspace <id> --label <name> --cwd <path> --focus`
- **split** (`-p` / `--split`): `herdr pane split --current --direction <right|down> --cwd <path> --focus`, and only those two

[herdr](https://herdr.dev) drives its own server over a socket, so both verbs are control commands rather than a `new-window` equivalent. Four details differ from tmux and zellij:

- **the split direction is not optional.** herdr's parser has no default for `--direction`, so gwm always passes one. Since #589 the value comes from `--direction` or from `[tui] mux_pane_direction` rather than from a hardcoded `right`. herdr declares `[possible values: right, down]`, so the `left` and `up` that #611 added for tmux and zellij are **refused** here rather than translated into something else.
- **the split takes no label.** A herdr pane is named after the fact with `herdr pane rename`, and `pane split` reads a bare argument as the pane to split, so gwm passes the worktree name only on `tab create`.
- **`--focus` is not the default.** Both verbs come back `"focused": false` without it, where `tmux new-window` and `zellij action new-tab` move you to what they create. gwm passes it so herdr is not the one backend that opens the worktree out of sight.
- **the new tab is pinned to your workspace.** Without `--workspace`, herdr targets the workspace the _server_ has focused, which is another project's window as often as not. gwm passes `$HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`, which every managed pane carries; outside one, the flag is dropped and herdr picks. A split needs none of this, `--current` already resolves the workspace.

A third level exists on herdr with no CLI equivalent: `herdr workspace create --label <name> --cwd <path> --focus`, reachable from the TUI's `t` through [`[tui] mux_open_in = "workspace"`](/configuration/gwm-toml#mux_open_in). tmux and zellij have no level above the tab, so they refuse that setting rather than open something else.

Verified against **herdr 0.8.2**, against a live server rather than the help text: the focus and workspace behaviours above were both measured, and both are the opposite of what the flag names suggest.

## Required session

All three commands require the corresponding multiplexer to actually be running:

- `gwm tmux` checks for `$TMUX` in the environment.
- `gwm zellij` checks for `$ZELLIJ`.
- `gwm herdr` checks for `$HERDR_ENV`, which herdr sets to `1` in every pane it manages.

One caveat on that last one, upstream rather than gwm's: a tmux server started from inside a herdr pane copies the whole `HERDR_*` set into its server-global environment ([herdrdev/herdr#2134](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/issues/2134)), so unrelated sessions on that server also claim to be herdr panes. The TUI's `t` is unaffected, since those sessions have `$TMUX` set and tmux comes first in the cascade. `gwm herdr <pattern>` typed in such a session will reach a stale pane id and herdr will refuse it, which surfaces as a failed command rather than a wrong tab.

Outside a session, the command **refuses** with a clear error rather than spawning a stray server: the alternative (spawning detached) leads to orphaned sessions that the user never sees.

```bash
$ gwm tmux auth
gwm tmux requires an active tmux session ($TMUX is not set).
```

## Fuzzy matching

The `<pattern>` arg uses the same fuzzy matcher as `gwm path / remove / bootstrap` ([nucleo-matcher](https://docs.rs/nucleo-matcher)). Ambiguous matches exit `1` and print both candidates without spawning anything.
